# 🌍 Norphan

Welcome to the official GitHub for **Norphan**! Our mission is to create a social media platform dedicated to supporting orphans, displaced families, and communities in crisis. **Initially, we are focusing on providing critical aid and rebuilding efforts in regions deeply impacted by conflict, such as the **Gaza Strip**, **South Lebanon**, and other vulnerable areas.** 

## 🎯 Mission

Our goal is to drive immediate and impactful support to regions in urgent need, providing resources to rebuild homes, hospitals, schools, and community centers destroyed by conflict. This focus is **short-term**, with an expected initial phase of **2–4 years** to support recovery efforts until these communities achieve safer, more stable living conditions. Long-term, Norphan’s mission will shift to **sponsoring orphans (those under 18 who have lost their fathers) and supporting impoverished communities** worldwide.

## ✨ What We’re Working On

- **Social Media Platform for Global Support and Rebuilding**: Developing a platform where users can support those in crisis through donations, sponsorships, and shared stories of resilience. Norphan will contribute **40% of our net income (after taxes and expenses)** toward aid and rebuilding efforts in high-need areas like Gaza and South Lebanon. The remaining **60% will be allocated for reinvestment and dividends** to ensure Norphan’s sustainability, growth, and ability to attract future investment.

- **Transparency and Impact Reporting**: Creating tools to provide real-time reporting on the impact of aid and rebuilding efforts, so our community can track the difference their support is making.

- **Strategic Partnerships for Greater Impact**: Partnering with trusted NGOs, humanitarian organizations, and local entities to maximize the effectiveness and accountability of our rebuilding efforts.

## 🚀 Key Repositories

- **Frontend Development** - Codebase for Norphan's user-facing platform.
- **Backend API** - Server and API powering Norphan’s services.
- **Impact Dashboard** - Our custom dashboard where users can track donations, view impact metrics, and access financial reports in real-time.

## 📊 Transparency & Accountability

Transparency is central to Norphan’s mission. We work with independent auditors and financial transparency organizations to ensure all funds are directed where they are needed most. **40% of our net income (post-expenses and taxes) is dedicated to direct aid and rebuilding efforts,** and **60% to reinvestment and dividends**, supporting Norphan’s growth, sustainability, and mission to aid high-need areas like Gaza and South Lebanon.

- **Financial Reports**: Published quarterly and accessible via our [Impact Dashboard Repository](#).
- **Open Source Tools**: Our technology stack is open source, fostering transparency and empowering other social impact initiatives.
