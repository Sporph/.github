# 🌍 Norphan

Welcome to the official GitHub for **Norphan**! Our mission is to create a social media platform dedicated to supporting orphans and impoverished communities, especially in war-torn and vulnerable regions around the world, including **Gaza Strip** and other heavily impacted areas.

## 🎯 Mission

Our goal is to bring positive change by providing direct financial support, resources, and community engagement for millions of orphans and families in need. We strive to build a platform that not only connects people with a purpose but also ensures complete transparency in fund distribution and impact reporting.

## ✨ What We’re Working On

- **Social Media Platform for Good**: Building a platform where users can support those in need through donations, sponsorships, and engaging with inspiring stories of resilience and hope. We are committed to contributing **50% of our net income (after taxes and expenses)** toward direct aid and initiatives that uplift communities in need, especially those affected by war and crisis, like in Gaza and similar regions.

- **Transparency and Impact Reporting**: Developing tools to provide real-time financial and impact reports, so our community can see where their contributions are making a difference.

- **Community Partnerships**: Collaborating with NGOs, humanitarian organizations, and transparency certification bodies to maximize our impact and accountability.

## 🚀 Key Repositories

- **Frontend Development** - The frontend codebase for the platform.
- **Backend API** - The backend server and API that powers the platform.
- **Impact Dashboard** - Our custom transparency dashboard where users can track donations, see impact metrics, and access real-time financial reports.
- **Documentation** - All project documentation, including API docs, transparency reports, and governance guidelines.

## 📊 Transparency & Accountability

We’re committed to transparency. Norphan is working with independent auditors and financial transparency organizations to ensure that every dollar is accounted for and directed toward those who need it most. **50% of our net income (post-expenses and taxes) will be allocated to aid efforts,** ensuring that our platform has a substantial impact on the lives of those we serve, especially in high-need areas such as Gaza and other crisis regions.

- **Financial Reports**: Published quarterly and accessible through our [Impact Dashboard Repository](#).
- **Open Source Tools**: We aim to open-source critical parts of our technology stack, especially tools that can empower other social impact projects to enhance transparency and trust.
