# 🌍 Sporph

Welcome to the official GitHub for **Sporph**! Our mission is to create a social media platform dedicated to supporting orphans, displaced families, and communities in crisis. **Initially, we are focusing on providing critical aid and rebuilding efforts in regions deeply impacted by conflict, such as the **Gaza Strip**, **South Lebanon**, and other vulnerable areas.** 

## 🎯 Mission

Our goal is to drive immediate and impactful support to regions in urgent need, providing resources to rebuild homes, hospitals, schools, and community centers destroyed by conflict. This focus is **short-term**, with an expected initial phase of **2–4 years** to support recovery efforts until these communities achieve safer, more stable living conditions. Long-term, Sporph’s mission will shift to **sponsoring orphans (those under 18 who have lost their fathers) and supporting impoverished communities** worldwide.

## ✨ What We’re Working On

- **Social Media Platform for Global Support and Rebuilding**: Sporph is building a platform where users can support communities in crisis through interactive features, including shared stories of resilience. Once financially stable, Sporph will dedicate **up to 40% of net income (after taxes and expenses)** toward aid and rebuilding efforts in high-need areas like Gaza and South Lebanon. The remaining **60% will be allocated for reinvestment and dividends** to ensure Sporph’s sustainability, growth, and long-term impact.

- **Transparency and Impact Reporting**: Creating tools to provide real-time reporting on the impact of aid and rebuilding efforts, so our community can track the difference their support is making.

- **Strategic Partnerships for Greater Impact**: Partnering with trusted NGOs, humanitarian organizations, and local entities to maximize the effectiveness and accountability of our rebuilding efforts.

## 🚀 Key Repositories

- **Frontend Development** - Codebase for Sporph's user-facing platform.
- **Backend API** - Server and API powering Sporph’s services.
- **Impact Dashboard** - Our custom dashboard where users can track donations, view impact metrics, and access financial reports in real-time.
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive project documentation, including API references, transparency reports, and governance guidelines.

## 📊 Transparency & Accountability

Transparency is foundational to Sporph’s mission. We work with independent auditors and financial transparency organizations to ensure that funds reach where they are most needed. Sporph is committed to a **scalable profit-sharing model**:

- **Initial Stages**: Funds will be directed toward platform building, scaling, and growth.
- **Post-Stability**: Up to **40% of net income** (post-expenses and taxes) will go toward aid and rebuilding efforts.
- **Sustainability & Growth**: The remaining income will be used for reinvestment or dividends to ensure Sporph’s growth and operational sustainability.

- **Financial Reports**: Published quarterly and accessible via our [Impact Dashboard Repository](#).
- **Open Source Tools**: Our technology stack is open source, fostering transparency and empowering other social impact initiatives.
